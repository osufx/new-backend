# new-backend
New backend made in python

The first one was made in php and should rather be called a php mess of list manipulation and such...
And out of nowhere php have started being more and more unstable to the point where it just timesout.

This python version will cache the sql info aswell so it responds even faster???

There will also be an recache function that will only be applied on database changes. (I want to move away from manualy editing the database)
